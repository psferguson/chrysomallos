linking semi-resolved objects to observational selection functions through ssi

# Installation
Chrysomallos assumes that the (LSST science pipelines)[https://pipelines.lsst.io/install/index.html] have been installed and setup. Additionaly, ArtPop is required.

Once the science pipelines have been installed and setup this package can be setup as well by running the following from the base directory:
```
setup -j -r .
```

# generating dwarf parameters
# generating dwarf catalogs
# injecting dwarf catalogs into an image
For injection there are two main use cases that require slightly different workflows.
## injections to be ingested into the butler
## injections for postage stamps
